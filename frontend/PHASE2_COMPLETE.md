## Code Structure

```
frontend/
├── app/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   └── page.tsx                    # Updated with navigation
│   └── reservations/
│       └── page.tsx                    # Main reservations page
├── components/
│   └── status-badge.tsx                # Status badge component

│   └── types/
│       └── api.types.ts                # TypeScript types (existing)
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

The following features are planned for Phase 3:
- Status management controls
- Conflict detection warnings
- Available slots calendar
- Status summary dashboard
- Auto-update statuses
- Conflict checking before creating/updating

## Notes

- All datetime values are displayed in the user's local timezone
- Date formatting uses `date-fns` library
- Status colors follow the design system:
  - **WAITING**: Blue (#2196F3)
  - **ACTIVE**: Green (#4CAF50)
  - **ENDING_SOON**: Orange (#FF9800)
  - **COMPLETED**: Gray (#9E9E9E)
- The UI maintains consistency with the existing authentication pages
- All API calls use the same axios instance with token interceptors

## Known Limitations

- Pagination is server-side (10 items per page)
- Search is not debounced (searches on every keystroke)
- No bulk operations yet (delete multiple, update multiple)
- No export functionality (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- No calendar/timeline view (table view only)

These limitations will be addressed in future phases.
