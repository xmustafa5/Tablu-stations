# Tablu Station Reservation - Implementation Phases

## Phase 1: Authentication System (Current Phase)
**Goal**: Implement complete JWT-based authentication with user management

### Features
- User registration with email/password
- User login with JWT token generation
- Token refresh mechanism
- Get current user profile
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT middleware for protected routes
- Role-based access control (USER, ADMIN)

### Deliverables
1. Updated Prisma schema for User model
2. Authentication service (`auth.service.ts`)
3. Token service (`token.service.ts`)
4. Authentication controller (`auth.controller.ts`)
5. Authentication routes (`auth.routes.ts`)
6. Authentication middleware (already created)
7. Comprehensive unit tests for all authentication features

### Test Coverage
- User registration (success, duplicate email, validation)
- User login (success, invalid credentials)
- Token generation and verification
- Token refresh
- Protected route access
- Password hashing and comparison

## Phase 2: Reservation CRUD Operations
**Goal**: Implement complete reservation management system

### Features
- Create reservation
- List all reservations with pagination
- Get single reservation by ID
- Update reservation
- Delete reservation
- Search functionality (advertiser, customer, location)
- Status filtering (waiting, active, ending_soon, completed)
- Calendar view endpoint

### Deliverables
1. Updated Prisma schema for Reservation model
2. Reservation service (`reservation.service.ts`)
3. Reservation controller (`reservation.controller.ts`)
4. Reservation routes (`reservation.routes.ts`)
5. Input validation middleware
6. Unit and integration tests

### Test Coverage
- CRUD operations for reservations
- Pagination and filtering
- Search functionality
- Authorization (users can only modify their own reservations)
- Input validation

  - ENDING_SOON: less than 48 hours until end time
  - COMPLETED: end time has passed
- Prevent overlapping reservations (optional)
- Scheduled cron jobs for status updates
- Bulk status update (admin only)

### Deliverables
1. Status service (`status.service.ts`)
2. Cron job scheduler
3. Bulk update endpoint
4. Business logic tests

### Test Coverage
- Status calculation logic
- Cron job execution
- Bulk updates
- Overlap detection

---

## Phase 4: Statistics & Dashboard
**Goal**: Provide analytics and insights

### Features
- Total reservations count
- Active reservations count
- Reservations by status
- Recent reservations
- User-specific statistics
- Date range filtering

### Deliverables
1. Statistics service (`stats.service.ts`)
2. Statistics controller (`stats.controller.ts`)
3. Statistics routes (`stats.routes.ts`)
4. Dashboard endpoint
5. Tests for statistics calculations

## Phase 5: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Enhance system with additional capabilities

### Features
- Advanced search with multiple filters
- Export reservations (CSV/PDF)
- Email notifications
- Audit logging
- Soft delete for reservations

### Deliverables
1. Search service with advanced filters

- Error handling and user feedback

### Deliverables
1. Auth pages (`/login`, `/register`)
2. Auth context and hooks
3. API client with interceptors
4. Protected route components
5. Updated reservation list/calendar pages

---

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Goal**: Ensure system reliability and performance

### Features
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Load testing
- Security testing
- API documentation with Swagger

### Deliverables
1. Complete test suite (80%+ coverage)
2. Integration test scenarios
3. E2E test suite
4. Performance test results
5. Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

---

## Phase 8: Deployment & DevOps
**Goal**: Deploy to production environment

### Features
- Environment configuration
- Database migration strategy
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and logging
- Error tracking (Sentry)
